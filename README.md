## Project Goals
1. **Project Context**
    * For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
2. **Project Objectives**
    * Build a message generator program using JavaScript
    * Use Git version control
    * Use command line
    * Develop locally on your computer
3. **My Project**
    * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Mixed-Messages-cdmy) gives you a travel recommendation based on a few random locations and random activiites and landmarks in those locations.
4. **Output Example**
    * For your next trip, visit Tokyo and enjoy exploring temples in Asakusa. Don't miss the modern architecture of Tokyo Skytree!
    * For your next trip, visit New York City and enjoy exploring the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Don't miss the iconic Statue of Liberty!
    * For your next trip, visit Paris and enjoy cruising the Seine River. Don't miss the romantic Montmartre district!
